# Neural and Evolutionary Computation (NEC)

## Activity 1: Prediction with Back-Propagation and Linear Regression

The goal of this activity is to practice with different types of supervised models. In particular we are going to use the three following:
* Multiple Linear Regression (MLR-F), using the sklearn python library.
* Neural Network with Back-Propagation (BP), implemented by the student.
* Neural Network with Back-Propagation (BP-F), using a python library (pytorch/tensorflow).
